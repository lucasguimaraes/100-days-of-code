# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 24, 2018 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100daysOfCode repository, will continue on my work with Rails Tutorial https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app

**Thoughts:** I know too little about Ruby and Rails, but this railstutorial has been very helpful and I want to learn by doing it.

**Link to work:** [Toy_App](https://bitbucket.org/lucaspmguima/toy_app/src)
