# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 24, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100daysOfCode repository, will continue on my work with Rails Tutorial https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app

**Thoughts:** I know too little about Ruby and Rails, but this railstutorial has been very helpful and I want to learn by doing it.

### Day 1: October 25, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Continued my study about Ruby on Rails working on the toy_app. Put the gem bootstrap dependecy into the project with success and made some css ajustments. Generated the scaffold code for the microposts contet.

**Thoughts:** The scaffold process is beautifull to watch, tho I don't know a lot about what he's generating. But that keep me going and wanting more.

### Day 2: October 26, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Had some issues at editing the user show page to display the content of the user's first micropost. But searching on google i manage to solve it.

**Thoughts:** This was the first exercise that i could not do it by myself
